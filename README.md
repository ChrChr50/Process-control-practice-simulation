# Process-control-practice-simulation
The Python code included in this repository is a simulation of a PID control mechanism for an ultrasonic reactor. While much of the Python script used originated from APMonitor.com, deriving the ultrasonic reactor's concentration balance function was done by myself.

The information for the derivation of the ultrasonic reactor's concentration balance was gathered from Gondrexon et al.'s "Degradation of Pentachlorophenol Aqueous Solutions Using a Continuous Flow Ultrasonic Reactor: Experimental Performance and Modelling" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1350417798000418)

The base template for the PID control Python code is from https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ProportionalIntegralDerivative
