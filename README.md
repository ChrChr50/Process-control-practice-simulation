# Process-control-practice-simulation
The Python code included in this repository is a simulation of a PID control mechanism for an ultrasonic reactor.

The information for the derivation of the ultrasonic reactor's mass balance and the data were gathered from Gondrexon et al.'s "Degradation of Pentachlorophenol Aqueous Solutions Using a Continuous Flow Ultrasonic Reactor: Experimental Performance and Modelling" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1350417798000418)

The base template for the PID control Python code is from https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ProportionalIntegralDerivative
